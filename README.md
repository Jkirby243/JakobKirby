This repository is a collection of projects and assignments that I have worked on.

**File Breakdown**

**Game Project**
-This is a game I made with a partner for my intro to game programming class. I programmed all the main gameplay features such as the movement, main recoil mechanic and physics, checkpoints, platforms, and other features all with playing the game. My partner made all items that appear in the second level.

- The iteration reports all files that show the growth of the game on a 6 week basis.

- The video demos are all the demos that appear in the iteration reports but are not on a drive. The Level 1 & 3 videos are me playing throuhg the levels I made and explaining the process behind their creating and creating the game systems.

- Recoil-Build is the built game. This has the .exe and files needed to run it. You may need to extract the files to run but you just have to run the .exe. Sadly there are still some bugs and if you want to quit or got soft locked in level 2 you will need to alt-tab and manualy shutdown the game.

**Website Data Project Files**
-These are files that are all for a website I made with a group of 5 other people. I was the main person who created and assisted with the PHP as I took on the task of being the memeber of the group who learned it. This assistance was in formatting sql to work better in php as well as protecting against sql injection and linking the sql database to the website. I also took what i learned from the php learning material I had to find out of class and find solutions to apply it to our current project and needs. The Powerpoint is also 

- The Report Documents are the 2 Report and breakdown documents we had to create for the project.

- The finished Figi Hotel are all the php and necessary files to run the website. The site is not hosted and will require a local host and database, as we did not have time to be able to host the site.
