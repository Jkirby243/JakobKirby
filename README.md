This repository is a collection of projects and assignments that I have worked on.

**File Breakdown**

**Game Project**
-This is a game I made with a partner for my intro to game programming class. I programmed all the main gameplay features such as the movement, main recoil mechanic and physics, checkpoints, platforms, and other features all with playing the game. My partner made all items that appear in the second level.

- The iteration reports all files that show the growth of the game on a 6 week basis.

- The video demos are all the demos that appear in the iteration reports but are not on a drive. The Level 1 & 3 videos are me playing throuhg the levels I made and explaining the process behind their creating and creating the game systems.

- Recoil-Build is the built game. This has the .exe and files needed to run it. You may need to extract the files to run but you just have to run the .exe. Sadly there are still some bugs and if you want to quit or got soft locked in level 2 you will need to alt-tab and manualy shutdown the game.

**Capstone Game Project**
The actual files for the game are to large to be placed here but this game is available to play.
- Game was developed in the span of around 2 months
- I was the project lead and did scheduling and planning for the 5 other members

**Skin Legion Identification Project** 
Although not as large as some of the other project on this repository I am still proud of this project
-C++ based opencv project
-Skin legion extraction with minor cancer identification
-Took basic image procecing functionalities and modeled them after Machine Learning based research papers to be able to get the same results

**Masters Thesis**
This was my masters thesis featuring the original research I completed on VR Haptic Glove Typing within Unity.
- Completed over a span of around 3 years
- Was able to have a conference paper be accepted to DSP an A2 rated Conference. (Currently awaiting publication)
